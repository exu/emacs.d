= switch-window

== Window switching, the visual way.

See http://tapoueh.org/emacs/switch-window.html, then install the
+switch-window.el+ file here (with http://github.com/dimitri/el-get it's
even easier).

== Manual install

Download the file or +git clone git://github.com/dimitri/el-get.git+ then do
the following, which will steal your +C-x o+ key:

  (require 'switch-window)
