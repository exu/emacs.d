;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements an extension to org-mode that synchnonizes
;; org document with external services.  It provides an interface that
;; can be implemented in backends.  The current focus is on
;; bugtrackers services.

;; The entry points are `os-import', `os-sync' and `os'.  The first
;; one prompts for a URL to import, the second one pulls, merges and
;; pushes every buglists in the current buffer and the third one
;; combines the others in one function: if nothing in the buffer can
;; be synchronized, ask for an URL to import.

;; The usual workflow is first to import your buglist with
;; `os-import', modify it or add a bug and run `os-sync'.

;; A buglist is a top-level headline which has a :url: in its
;; PROPERTIES block.  This headline is composed of a list of
;; subheadlines which corresponds to bugs.  The requirement for a bug
;; is to have a state, a title and an id.  If you add a new bug, it
;; wont have an id but it will get one once you sync.  If you omit the
;; status, OPEN is chose.

;; The status is an org TODO state.  It can be either OPEN or CLOSED.
;; The title is just the title of the headline.  The id is a number in
;; the PROPERTIES block of the headline.

;; Org DEADLINE timestamp are also handled and can be inserted in a
;; bug headline which can then be used by the backend if it supports
;; it.

;; Paragraphs under bug-headlines are considered as their description.
;; Additionnal data used by the backend are in the PROPERTIES block of
;; the bug.

;; To add a bug, just insert a new headline under the buglist you want
;; to modify e.g.:
;;     ** OPEN my new bug
;; Then simply call `os-sync'.

;;; Code:

;; The data structures used to represent bugs and buglists are simple
;; plists.  It is what backend have to handle, process or return.

;; Buglist example:

;; '(:title "My buglist"
;;   :url "http://github.com/repos/octocat/Hello-World"
;;   :bugs (BUGS...))

;; Bug example:

;; '(:id 3
;;   :status 'open or 'closed
;;   :sync 'conflict-local or 'conflict-remote
;;   :title "foo"
;;   :desc "blah"
;;   :priority "major"
;;   :tags ("a" "b" "c")
;;   :author "Aur√©lien"
;;   :assignee "Foo"
;;   :milestone "foo"

;;   ;; dates are regular emacs time object
;;   :date-deadline ...
;;   :date-creation ...
;;   :date-modification ...

;;   ;; backend-specific properties
;;   ;; ...
;;   )

;; Some accesors are available for both structure.  See `os-set-prop',
;; and `os-get-prop'.


;; When importing an URL, Org-sync matches the URL against the
;; variable `os-backend-alist' which maps regexps to backend symbols.
;; The backend symbol is then used to call the backend functions.
;; When these functions are called, the variable `os-backend' and
;; `os-base-url' are dynamically bound to respectively the backend
;; symbol and the cannonical URL for the thing you are synching with.

;; The symbol part in a `os-backend-alist' pair must be a variable
;; defined in the backend.  It is an alist that maps verb to function
;; symbol.  Each backend must implement at least 3 verbs:

;; * base-url (param: URL)

;; Given the user URL, returns the cannonical URL to represent it.
;; This URL will be available dynamically to all of your backend
;; function through the `os-base-url' variable.

;; * fetch-buglist (param: LAST-FETCH-TIME)

;; Fetch the buglist at `os-base-url'.  If LAST-FETCH-TIME is non-nil,
;; and you only fetched things modified since it, you are expected to
;; set the property :since to it in the buglist you return.  You can
;; add whatever properties you want in a bug.  The lisp printer is
;; used to persist them in the buffer.

;; * send-buglist (param: BUGLIST)

;; Send BUGLIST to the repo at `os-base-url' and return the new bugs
;; created that way. A bug without an id in BUGLIST is a new bug, the
;; rest are modified bug.


;; When synchronizing, Org-sync parses the current buffer using
;; org-element and convert any found buglist headline to a buglist
;; data structure.  See `os-headline-to-buglist',
;; `os-headline-to-bug'.

;; When writing buglists back to the document, Org-sync converts them
;; to elements -- the data structure used by org-element -- which are
;; then interpreted by `org-element-interpret-data'.  The resulting
;; string is then inserted in the buffer.  See `os-buglist-to-element'
;; and `os-bug-to-element'.
